Generates English-like words using Markov chains based on the dictionary
supplied. Edit the script to define the dictionary, and optionally a file
to store probabilities for better repeat performance.

generate_password_2.rb has better word generation performance and smaller
storage for probabilities, but takes longer to generate the probabilities 
initially.

Usage:
	ruby generate_password_2.rb WORD_LENGTH [NUM_TO_GENERATE]

Tested with ruby 1.8.6.
